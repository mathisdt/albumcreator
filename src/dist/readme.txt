What's the purpose of AlbumCreator?
===================================

This utility allows to create compilations of music tracks.
Maybe you used to put all of your music files into one single
directory, and now you want to have individual album directories -
but the ID3 information is lost? You'll have to do it manually!

Use AlbumCreator to select tracks one after the other, and
the program will move the files and label them with a track number.
